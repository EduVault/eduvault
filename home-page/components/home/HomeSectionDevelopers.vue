        If you are building educational software, consider adding EduVault to
        your app. Give your users the benefits of interoperability and the
        confidence that they own their own data. The more apps that use
        EduVault, the more powerful and useful each app becomes.
      </p>
      <p class="max-w-sm md:max-w-xl mb-3">
        New apps can directly use EduVault as their cloud storage and
        authentication provider. Already operation apps can ‘connect to
        EduVault’.
